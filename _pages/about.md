I am currently undertaking my PhD in music psychology at the Royal Northern College of Music [Centre for Music Performance Research](https://www.rncm.ac.uk/research/research-centres-rncm/centre-for-music-performance-research/) and Manchester Metropolitan University. My AHRC-funded PhD project involves developing and testing an online intervention on effective practice and performance preparation for conservatoire piano students. I am also passionate about making research accessible, and am currently leading [Flourish](https://musiciansflourish.org/), a funded project that aims to communicate research findings from performance science to music students in interesting and engaging ways. I also have a blog (<a href="https://psycformusos.com/" target="_blank">Psyc for Musos</a>) where I write posts with research-based information and tips for performing musicians.

## Research interests

My research interests broadly lie in the field of music performance psychology, but I am interested in any research that is about finding ways to support musicians better. Specific areas of interest include:

- Effective music practice
- Self-regulated learning
- Music performance anxiety
- Musicians' performance-related pain
- Support and provisions for conservatoire music students
- Scale development and validation
- Intervention development and testing
- Use of technology to support musicians
